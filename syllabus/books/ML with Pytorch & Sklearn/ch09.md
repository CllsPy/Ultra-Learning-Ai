# Linear Regression 
We can divide in simple and multi-variable problems, the simple one is defioned as follow: y = wix + b, The point is mesure the relationshop between two variables, late you'll see how to expand it to many.

The b here, represents the intercept in the y axis, and w the weights, our mission is to find w that enable us to predict unseen values based on its relationshiop.
