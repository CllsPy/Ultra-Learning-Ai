# Linear Regression 
We can divide in simple and multi-variable problems, the simple one is defioned as follow: y = wix + b, The point is mesure the relationshop between two variables, late you'll see how to expand it to many.

The b here, represents the intercept in the y axis, and w the weights, our mission is to find w that enable us to predict unseen values based on its relationshiop.

The objetive of linear regression is to fit the best possible line, based on our data. 

## Multiple Linear Regression
For a problem with 'n' features, we apply a sum at our original (univariete) equation.
